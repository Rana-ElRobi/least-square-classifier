# fisher-linear-classiffier
This repo implements a Fisher’s linear discriminant classifier that can recognize scanned images of the 26 lower-case characters provided in the file “Assignment 1 Dataset.zip”. The zip file contains two folders: “Train” and “Test”. The “Train” folder contains 7 images for each lower-case character while the “Test” folder contains 2 images for each lower-case character. The images in the “Train” folder should be used to train a classifier for each character using the method given at the bottom of slide 9 in Lecture 2.pdf. After the classifiers are trained, test each classifier using the images given in the “Test” folder.
